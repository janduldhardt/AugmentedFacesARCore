This is my term project for Computer Vision / Intelligent System Development 2/2019.

The goal is to detect faces and apply graphics on those detected faces.
For implementation this Android application written in Kotlin uses ARCore SDK by Google.

Two ways of applying the graphics:
- Apply via facial landmarks
- Apply based on face mesh
